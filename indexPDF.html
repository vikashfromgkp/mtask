            <section>
                Welcome to our first newsletter of 2017! It's been a while since
                the last one, and a lot has happened. We promise to keep them coming
                every two months hereafter, and permit ourselves to make this one
                rather long. The big news is the beginnings of our launch in the
                American market, but there are also interesting updates on sales,
                development, mentors and (of course) the investment round that closed
                in January.
            </section>
            <section>
                <b>New capital:</b> The investment round was successful. We raised 2.13
                MNOK to match the 2.05 MNOK loan from Innovation Norway. Including the
                development agreement with Filmlance International, the total new
                capital is 5 MNOK, partly tied to the successful completion of
                milestones. All formalities associated with this process are now
                finalized.

                <b>Sales:</b> Return customer rate is now 80%, proving value and
                willingness to pay. Film Factory Montreal is our first customer in
                Canada. Lumiere Numeriques have started using us in France. We also
                have new customers in Norway, and high-profile users such as Gareth
                Unwin, producer of Oscar-winning <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504320/" contenteditable="false" style="cursor: pointer;">The King's Speech</a>. Revenue for the
                first four months is 200 kNOK, compared to 339 kNOK for all of 2016.
                We are working on a partnership to safeguard sales in Norway while
                beginning to focus more on the US.

                <b>New team members:</b> We've extended our organization with two
                permanent developers <!--(Adrian Kaczmarek and Mike Mikina)--> based in Łódź,
                the film capital of Poland. <!--Jiggyasa Agrawal and Paraskevi Nova, t--> Two
                highly skilled interns from the University of Oslo's Entrepreneurship
                Program, will be working on market research until mid-June (starting
                in March), preparing for the US launch. <!--Dominik Plšek, Kristoffer
                    Solheim and Paul Sanzenbacher--> Also, two computer science students are working as
                part-time interns during spring, on machine learning and analysis
                research, as well as innovative architectures based on the Swift
                language. We hope our interns will consider sticking around!
            </section>
            <section>
                <b>New mentor:</b> We are honored to have Caitlin Burns joining us
                as a mentor. She's an accomplished producer based in New York, an
                active member of the Producers Guild of America, and the collaboration
                has already yielded good results, including valuable contacts for our
                visit in Los Angeles. Oscar-winning VFX supervisor Dave Stump joined
                us earlier.
            </section>
            <section>
                <b>New York, St. Louis, San Francisco and Los Angeles:</b> Pontus and
                Audun did a tour of the US in February and March, meeting users,
                partners and potential customers<!-- (as well as Cathi and Chuck Vaaler,
                    our new investors in St. Louis)-->. The trip was very successful, with
                several high points, including meetings with Netflix, the Academy of
                Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the International Cinematographers
                Guild, Local 871 (the script supervisors' union), one of the world's
                leading DITs, and Apple. See the separate attachment for a more
                detailed summary.

                <b>NAB:</b> Andreas and Audun travelled to the National Association
                of Broadcasters convention (NAB) in Las Vegas for three hectic days in
                April. NAB gathers 100,000 participants from film and TV. It's a very
                efficient way of meeting people in the business, and getting an
                updated picture of the business landscape. The most exciting meeting
                was with PIX System, one of our most important competitors. It was
                interesting to note that they regarded the indie market as bigger than
                their own.
                <p>Andreas was able to secure us an invitation to the DIT-WIT party,
                    with some of the world's leading DITs in attendance. It was a great
                    place for informal feedback on Drylab Viewer. The pattern was the same
                    as for other users: Initial polite interest turns to real enthusiasm
                    the moment someone is able to personally try Drylab Viewer! We also
                    met with Pomfort and Apple about our on-going collaborations; ARRI
                    and Teradek/Paralinx about camera integration; Amazon, Google and IBM about cloud computing.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <b>WWDC and Silicon Valley:</b> We were very pleasantly surprised
                to be invited by Apple to their World Wide Developers Conference in
                San Jose in June, despite not having applied. It's a valuable chance
                to learn and make new connections. We’re also setting aside time to
                meet other potential partners.
            </section>
            <section>
                <b>Cine Gear:</b> We have decided not to attend the Cine Gear expo
                in L.A. this year, since feedback from many users about the show were
                mixed, and our planned beta version of 3.0 is slightly delayed.
            </section>
            <section>
                <b>Development and launch:</b> Development is around one month
                behind our original schedule. We expect the delay to decrease, with
                new developers on board.
                <p>The launch of Drylab 3.0 will take place at the International
                    Broadcasters Convention in Amsterdam in September, and we are working
                    hard to get solid feedback from pilot users before then.
                </p>
            </section>
            <b>Annual General Meeting:</b> Drylab's AGM will be held on June
            16th at 15:00. An invitation will be distributed to all owners well in
            advance. We hope to see you there! 
            <section>
                <b>As you can see it has been a hectic spring that has given us a
                lot of confirmation about our product. We are now working eagerly and
                hard towards the US launch with Drylab 3.0, while keeping momentum in
                Europe with our existing system.</b>
